As you enter the dungeon, your eyes jump to the single occupant of the room you stand in: a statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. The room is filled with thick smoke. You see no fire, but that doesn't mean much when you can only see a few feet in front of you anyway. You start coughing -almost suffocated by the lack of air. The air is freezing, you start to shiver. Ice covers the floor, and you fear you might slip with every step you take. You immediately have a bad feeling about this place, this is no ordinary cavern. [For the DM] Mosters lurk throughout the dungeon, rooms are filled with Jerrys and Swarms of rats On the other side of the dungeon is the entrance to an ancient dwarven civilaztion, your group believes that there they might be able to gain some reward from the dwarves for clearing out the tunnel.
